# Movie-Recommender-System
Implementing a Simple Movie Recommender System using Item-Based Collaborative Filtering                
Notebook used : Google Colab       

1> Recommender systems are used to suggest movies or songs to users based on their interest or usage history.           
2> For example, Netflix recommends movies to watch based on the previous movies you've watched.            
3> In this example, we will use Item-based Collaborative Filter.                   

To Predict : Recommend Movies based on User's recently watched Movies' Ratings.
